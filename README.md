# Crypto Transaction Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project detects fraudulent cryptocurrency transactions using machine learning models trained on real blockchain data.

## Dataset
Elliptic Bitcoin Dataset containing transaction features, labels, and graph structure.

## Approach
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Handling class imbalance
- Baseline model: Logistic Regression
- Improved model: Random Forest
- Evaluation using precision, recall, confusion matrix
- Feature importance analysis

## Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Key Results
- Improved fraud recall using class-weighted models
- Random Forest outperformed baseline Logistic Regression
- Identified key transaction features contributing to fraud detection

## Future Work
- Graph-based ML using NetworkX
- Anomaly detection
- Model deployment using API
